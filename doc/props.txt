An account has following properties:

  account_id

    A unique ID for the account.  This is a 64-bit unsigned integer.

  name

    The label for the account, which is expected to be a short
    human-readable string.

  user_status

    status of the account.  Its semantics is application dependent
    (XXX this is not true for </cb>).  This is a 8-bit unsigned
    integer.

    For an account created by </create> or </cb>, its value will be 1.

  admin_status

    An integer, which is intended to be used for the
    administrator-controlled status of the account.  Its semantics is
    application dependent (XXX this is not true for </cb>).  This is a
    8-bit unsigned integer.

    For an account created by </create> or </cb>, its value will be 1.

  terms_version

    An integer, which is intended to be used as the last revision
    number of the terms of the application, agreed with the account's
    user.

    For an account created by </create> or </cb>, its value will be 0.
